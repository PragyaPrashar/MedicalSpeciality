# Medical Transcription Classification by Specialty  

This project focuses on classifying medical transcriptions based on their respective specialties. To achieve this, various machine learning algorithms were utilized, including **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Random Forest**. The transcription text was vectorized using multiple techniques such as **TF-IDF**, **Word2Vec**, and **RoBERTa** embeddings.  

After comparing the results across these models and vectorization methods, **SVM** consistently outperformed other classifiers, demonstrating superior accuracy and performance on multiple embeddings.  

## Key Highlights:  
- Implemented **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest** for classification.  
- Applied text vectorization methods like **TF-IDF**, **Word2Vec**, and **RoBERTa embeddings**.  
- Conducted comprehensive comparisons of model performance and embeddings.  
- **SVM** delivered the best results, outperforming other algorithms across the evaluated embeddings.  

This project provides insights into effective techniques for classifying medical texts, with potential applications in improving healthcare data organization and processing.
